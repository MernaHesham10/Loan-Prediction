# Loan-Prediction

- The idea behind this ML project is to build a model that will classify Loan status for each customer who can take loan or not
- It is based on the user’s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments and etc.

## Dataset
- The dataset “Train data” contain features of customers like marital status,education, number of dependents, and employments and etc. to detect the status of loan.

## The project implementation steps will go as follows
● Understand the dataset attributes
● Apply the required data preprocessing methods
● Implement different classification models to investigate the performance of each classifier on detecting the loan status for each customer
● Mention your observations and study the parameters (features) that play a vital role in accepting loan.
● After get the best classifier. Use “New Customer “ data to predict the loan for each new customer
● From the new customer data , what is the percentage of married people in semiurban area that obtained the loan ?
